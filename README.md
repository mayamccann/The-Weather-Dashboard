# The-Weather-Dashboard
Server-Side APIs with feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## ðŸ’¡ Background
For this assignment, the goal is to create a Weather Dashboard that focuses on Server-Side APIs. Third-party APIs grant access to its data and functionality through requests of specific parameters to a URL. Obtaining data from another application's APIs and using it for their own purposes is common among developers.  This challenges allows us to focus on our JavaScript skills and allows further practice with our HTML and CSS knowledge learned in the UConn Coding Bootcamp. It is significant to note that this Weather Dashboard can be shared with those in the computer science community.
